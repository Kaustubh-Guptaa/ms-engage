The Dataset is analyzed, model is generated and connected to Anvil's Web Application using Google Colaboratory.
Upload the MS_Final.ipynb notebook to the Google Colaboratory. Upload the Dataset to the notebook's directory and run the code.
Each code is documented under a text for better understanding on what's done.
Under 'Server Connection' there's a commented code - # pip install anvil-uplink, uncomment it if the code doesn't run further. After the installation:
  1. Restart Runtime
  2. Comment pip install anvil-uplink again.
  3. Re-run entire code again.
